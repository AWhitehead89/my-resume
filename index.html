    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <h4>Postperson OPG - Royal Mail Group</h4>
    <p>Feb 2019 - Present - Norwich, Norfolk</p>
    <p>I started working at the Royal Mail group as a Mail Sorter in Norwich Mail Centre after my time as a Christmas Casual. After a couple of months, I applied and was accepted to the position of Traffic Sampler. My duties involved collecting data on the inward and outward traffic streams. I did this by separating direct and secondary sorted mail into different containers and counting each type of mail. I also counted full containers of different traffic streams for the ACCs. I input the data into a spreadsheet and uploaded it to a server, filing any paperwork into folders. I created my own rota based on the targets given for each quarter and worked independently as well as part of a small team. I moved to a full-time position on nights, sorting normal and tracked items.</p>
